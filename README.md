# Smith & Crown Challenge

Basic useful feature list:
I decided to use React for my challenge due to me being very comfortable with the framework.
I ended up not using redux to manage the state for this assignment because the state tree
was pretty small. To make a request I used the fetch API which is built into React. Also
lastly I used a npm package to handle the drop down menu because they can be tricky to style
with vanilla css.
